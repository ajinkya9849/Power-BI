# TATA Ecommerce Sales Dashboard - Power BI Project

## Overview

This repository contains the **TATA Ecommerce Sales Dashboard** project, developed using **Power BI** to analyze and visualize ecommerce sales performance. By integrating data from two primary sources: **“Orders”** and **“Details”**, this dashboard provides actionable insights into TATA’s ecommerce operations, covering metrics from quarterly sales trends to regional (state-wise) breakdowns and product-level performance.

The dashboard helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions, optimize sales strategies, and enhance operational efficiencies.

## Key Features

1. **Quarterly Sales Trends**  
   Track revenue and performance across each quarter, identify growth patterns, and analyze seasonal shifts.

2. **State-Wise Analysis**  
   Visualize sales data by region, identifying high-performing states and pinpointing regions requiring additional focus.

3. **Product Performance**  
   Understand product-level performance, including sales volume, revenue, and trends for top-selling and underperforming products.

4. **Customer Insights**  
   Gain insights into customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and retention trends to guide marketing strategies and optimize customer targeting.

5. **Efficiency Metrics**  
   Measure operational performance with KPIs such as average order processing time, delivery times, conversion rates, and more.

## Dashboard Interactivity

- **Filters**: Customize views based on **date range**, **product categories**, **regions**, and **order types**.
- **Drill-Down Capabilities**: Click on any data point to explore more detailed insights, whether it's a specific quarter, product, or region.

## How It Works

### Data Sources
- **“Orders”**: Contains transactional data, such as order IDs, product details, customer demographics, and revenue.
- **“Details”**: Provides metadata, including product categories, shipping info, and regional data.

The two datasets are linked together to provide a comprehensive view of ecommerce operations. By joining the data, users can analyze order quantities, product performance, regional sales, and customer behavior in an integrated way.

### Key Visualizations & Metrics
- **Revenue Insights**: Total revenue displayed by quarters, regions, and products.
- **Order Volume Analysis**: Total number of orders, order trends, and frequency analysis.
- **Product Performance**: Top-selling products and underperforming items.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Insights into customer demographics and purchase behaviors.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Delivery times, order processing efficiency, and conversion rates.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
- **Power BI Desktop** or **Power BI Service** (for publishing and sharing dashboards)
- **Data Files**: The datasets ("Orders" and "Details") need to be uploaded into Power BI for full functionality. You can modify the paths or replace the datasets as needed.

### Steps to Load the Project
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open **Power BI Desktop**.
3. Import the **“Orders”** and **“Details”** files.
4. Load the data into Power BI and apply the model built in this project.
5. Customize the filters and explore the data through interactive visuals.
6. Save and publish the dashboard as needed for sharing with stakeholders.
